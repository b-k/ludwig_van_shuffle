This branch includes a perl script and a shell script. They are largely
archival.

The perl script (from 2003) uses the directory structure. You have
one directory of one-track songs, and one with sets, each in its own
directory. We don't need a 'sets' file, but we do need a specific
directory structure.

The shell script is similar to the Python version, but it attempts to
use only POSIX-standard commands, so it can run on telephones or other
portable objects with a POSIX shell like busybox. Its fatal flaw is that
many characters in a file name (&, ()s, ""s, spaces) are a pain to work
around in the shell. On the pro-shell side, Python chokes when a name
is somehow inconsistent with the UTF-8 standard, while the shell will
faithfully copy whatever it gets. All of these problems may be common
with file names generated via CDDB or from certain music providers.
